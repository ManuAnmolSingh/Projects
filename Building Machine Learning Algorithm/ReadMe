# About the Task

#Purpose: The purpose of this assignment is to design a machine learning model which is capable to predict the probability of the person having a heart disease.

#Value: The fundamental values depicted by this assignment is that it can lead to faster diagnostic which saves time and ultimately it contributes to save many lives.

#Design Methodology: To make this model functional , many algorithms have been used to train and test the data. The two main classifiers used are ‘Decision Tree classifier’ and ‘Random Forest Classifier’.

#Findings: This technology delivers reliability to users and can also be used to predict the probability of features other than heart diseases.

#Platforms Used

The machine learning model requires an IDE, using IDE aids to
access a number of different modules and libraries which
promotes features like data analysis, data manipulation and many
more.

#Python :
Our project is totally Python based. Python is really powerful
scripting language, and best when it comes to Scientific
calculations. From data extraction to prediction, python plays
significant role.

#Anaconda - Jupyter :
This is a powerful tool for machine learning, it is both local and
cloud bases, multiple members can work on a project connecting
to cloud from anywhere. It has many inbuilt functions.

#Numpy :
Numpy is in Python Library, which gives a full performance when
array object comes into play.

#Pandas:
Pandas is used to manipulate the data and ease to use data
structure.

#Scikit Learn :
It is an open source machine learning tool for python. It includes various classifiers which
helps in solving classification and regression problems.
